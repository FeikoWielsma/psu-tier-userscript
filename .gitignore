# Generated Data (Optional: Keep user.js, ignore intermediates?)
# We keep psu_tier.html as strict source snapshot? 
# We keep psutier.user.js as it is the distribution.
# We might ignore the intermediate JSONs if we want to force generation.
# But for now, let's include them so the repo works out of the box.
# except maybe the huge temp lookup map? No, keep it for tests.
